## My work during the program
- My core work was to implement and example workload for edge devices and a webapp for visualizing data collected from the workloads. I have created the following apps:
  1. [Workload Edge Example App](https://github.com/ahmadateya/flotta-edge-example)
  2. [Webapp for data visualization - frontend](https://github.com/ahmadateya/flotta-webapp-frontend)
  3. [Webapp for data visualization - backend](https://github.com/ahmadateya/flotta-webapp-backend)
- Besides the core work, I have also contributed to the following repos:
  - [Project-Flotta.github.io - Project Docs](https://github.com/project-flotta/project-flotta.github.io), Created 3 blogposts for explaining the project and the work I have done.
     1. [Edge Example App: CPU Temperature](https://project-flotta.github.io/blog/2021/08/01/week-1.html)
     2. [Edge Example App: Sense the Internet Part 1](https://project-flotta.github.io/blog/2021/08/08/week-2.html)
